### Using Swift Package Manager

Add the binary target to your app's `Package.swift`:

```swift
.binaryTarget(
    name: "FabricSDK",
    url: "https://github.com/fabric-pbc/fabric-sdks-releases/releases/download/v0.3.3/FabricSDK.xcframework.zip",
    checksum: "dabeb13de049b5a4f4350eef45afc56a624ff4caceb5a016f641af984a836192"
)
```

Or download `Package.swift` from this release and reference it directly.

### Debug Symbols (dSYMs)

For crash symbolication in production:

1. Download `FabricSDK-dSYMs.zip` from this release
2. Upload to your crash reporting service:
   - **Firebase Crashlytics**: Add upload script to your build phase
   - **Sentry**: Use `sentry-cli upload-dif`
   - **Bugsnag**: Use `bugsnag-dsym-upload`
3. Or keep locally for manual symbolication with `symbolicatecrash` or `atos`

The dSYM package includes symbols for both iOS device (arm64) and simulator (arm64 + x86_64) builds.
